# Trump Tweets Data Exploration Project

This is an attempt to understand what kinds of tweets by Donald Trump become popular (i.e., are retweeted or favorited). 

I examine factors including the words used in tweets, the sentiment of tweets, and the topics of tweets. 
I also examine where users are retweeting from.

(Note that the Jupyter Notebook shows much of the work, but is unable to display the maps. Those can be seen in the pdf version.)
